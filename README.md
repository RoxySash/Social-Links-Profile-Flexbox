## My process

1. Initialized project as a public repository 
2. Configured repository to publish your code to a web address. 
3. Looked through the designs to started planning. 
4. Wrote HTML first then added CSS.
5. Wrote out the base styles for project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Worked from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I learned that I didnt need to use any unnecessary amount of divs.



### Continued development

For future projects I need to focus on improving my use of flexbox and css grids also adding fonts and using font weights.
